       <h1> Methods </h1>
        
          <ol>
               <li>The primary method of this study will be a focus group discussion with photo and film elicitation. 
                    <ul>
                  <li> The participants will be English-speaking adults with a mental health disability according to the Social Security Administration.</li>
                    <li> Photos or short clips of popular movies with mentally ill character will be shown and then a facilitated discussion will follow. 
                    <li> The facilitators will ask thing like “How would you describe this character? How do you think the other character’s feel about them? <br>
                         What do you things should be done to/for this person?  Do you think the director got something wrong about this character? How would <br> 
                         you feel if you were this character?  Etc.”  </li>
                    <li> Conversations will be recorded and transcribed and the facilitators will record people’s affect, engagement, mood presentation,<br>
                         and any changes that occur during the conversation. </li>
                    
                    <li> There would be 20-30 people in total with 4-5 per groups.</li> </ul>
               <li>The secondary method will The Self-Stigma in Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS) as used in Corrigan et al., 2016. </li>
               <ul>
                    <li>This survey would be given before and after the primary method to have a baseline and see if reports change based on the conversation. </li>
                    <li>The conversations and observations will be coded and analyzed to see how people experience the photos, clips, and discussion </li>
               </ul>
          </ol>
       <h2> Significance and Conclusion </h2>
       <p>This research would help fill the gap of understanding of how stigma around mental illness affects those that are living with it.
            It would help amplify the stories and experiences of this community and inform academics and activists at large to what needs to
            change in the mass media. It may also help researchers and treatment providers by giving them insight into how media-imposed stigma 
            is affecting people’s wellbeing and feelings towards their diagnosis and treatment.  Because mass media is so prevalent in society 
            and the day-to-day lives of most individuals, it’s important that we examine it’s effects. </p>
