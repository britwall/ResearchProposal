    <h1> How Do People Living with Mental Illnesses Experience <br> Mental Health Stigma in TV and Movies? </h1>
       <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p>Mental illness is a common theme in movies and tv, specifically in the thriller and horror genres. <br>
            But how do people living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) experience these stereotypes <br>
            and stigma? This project aims to explore some of the experiences and feelings of mentally ill individuals <br>
            brought on by mass media presentation of mental illness. Research in this area would be an important addition <br>
            to various fields of psychology, public health, and social stigma research and could inform treatment providers <br>
            directly. </p>
