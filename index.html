    <h1> How Do People Living with Mental Illnesses Experience <br> Mental Health Stigma in TV and Movies? </h1>
       <p> An Honor's 202 Project by Brittani Wallsten </p>
       <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p>Mental illness is a common theme in movies and tv, specifically in the thriller and horror genres. 
            But how do people living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) experience these stereotypes 
            and stigma? This project aims to explore some of the experiences and feelings of mentally ill individuals 
            brought on by mass media presentation of mental illness. Research in this area would be an important addition 
            to various fields of psychology, public health, and social stigma research and could inform treatment providers 
            directly. </p>
       <h2> Background </h2>
          <p> There have been many studies about the stigma surrounding mental illness and how it is perpetuated by the media. 
            These studies show that the way mental illness is portrayed in mass media has a broadly negative effect on public 
            attitudes both generally and personally (Kimmerle & Cress, 2013; Wahl, 1992).  There are also several studies about
            how self-stigma has significant consequences for people can have living with mental illness (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006;
            Livingston & Boyd, 2010; Colizzi, Ruggeri, & Lasalvia, 2020). There are far fewer studies done on how these stigmas and 
            stereotypes in the media are experienced by mentally ill individuals themselves (Stuart, 2006). The Stuart 2006 study does not 
               include contributation from individuals with diagonoses but rather speculates about how stigma may impact them. She notes that, 
               usually, before a person ever encounters someone with a severe mental illness or before a person recieves a diagnosis, they are 
               taught by the media about who they are and what they can do. Unfortunately, these tropes are usually negative and violent and  
               difficult to unlearn for both someone on the outside and for the patient.  </p>
