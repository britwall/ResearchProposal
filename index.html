    <h1> How Do People Living with Mental Illnesses Experience <br> Mental Health Stigma in TV and Movies? </h1>
       <p> An Honor's 202 Project by Brittani Wallsten </p>
       <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p>Mental illness is a common theme in movies and tv, specifically in the thriller and horror genres. <br>
            But how do people living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) experience these stereotypes <br>
            and stigma? This project aims to explore some of the experiences and feelings of mentally ill individuals <br>
            brought on by mass media presentation of mental illness. Research in this area would be an important addition <br>
            to various fields of psychology, public health, and social stigma research and could inform treatment providers <br>
            directly. </p>
       <h2> Background </h2>
          <p> There have been many studies about the stigma surrounding mental illness and how it is perpetuated by the media. <br>
            These studies show that the way mental illness is portrayed in mass media has a broadly negative effect on public <br>
            attitudes both generally and personally (Kimmerle & Cress, 2013; Wahl, 1992).  There are also several studies about<br>
            how self-stigma significant consequences for people can have living with mental illness (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006;<br>
            Livingston & Boyd, 2010; Colizzi, Ruggeri, & Lasalvia, 2020). There are far fewer studies done on how these stigmas and <br>
            stereotypes in the media are experienced by mentally ill individuals themselves (Stuart, 2006). </p>
