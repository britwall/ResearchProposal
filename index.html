    <h1> How Do People Living with Mental Illnesses Experience <br> Mental Health Stigma in TV and Movies? </h1>
       <p> An Honor's 202 Project by Brittani Wallsten </p>
       <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p>Mental illness is a common theme in movies and tv, specifically in the thriller and horror genres. <br>
            But how do people living with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) experience these stereotypes <br>
            and stigma? This project aims to explore some of the experiences and feelings of mentally ill individuals <br>
            brought on by mass media presentation of mental illness. Research in this area would be an important addition <br>
            to various fields of psychology, public health, and social stigma research and could inform treatment providers <br>
            directly. </p>
       <h2> Background </h2>
          <p> There have been many studies about the stigma surrounding mental illness and how it is perpetuated by the media. <br>
            These studies show that the way mental illness is portrayed in mass media has a broadly negative effect on public <br>
            attitudes both generally and personally (Kimmerle & Cress, 2013; Wahl, 1992).  There are also several studies about<br>
            how self-stigma significant consequences for people can have living with mental illness (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006;<br>
            Livingston & Boyd, 2010; Colizzi, Ruggeri, & Lasalvia, 2020). There are far fewer studies done on how these stigmas and <br>
            stereotypes in the media are experienced by mentally ill individuals themselves (Stuart, 2006). </p>
       <h2> Rationale </h2>
          <p> This study seeks to explore how people living with severe mental health diagnoses experience the portrayal of mental <br>
               illness on screen.  Many people with SPMI are isolated from the public by family, houselessness, or residential and <br>
               inpatient treatment programs. What impacts might this limited access and distorted presentations from the mass media <br>
               have on their sense of self and place in society? How might negative self-perception affect treatment outcomes and <br>
               overall wellbeing? And what do individuals see as areas of challenge or hope? The results of this study would have <br>
               implications broadly for mass media, mental healthcare, and health communication.  It could encourage media creators, <br>
               activists, treatment providers, public health officials, etc. to pay closer attention to how mental illness is showing up <br>
               in TV and movies, and hopefully to advocate for more accurate/positive representation. </p>
       <h2> Methods </h2>
          <ol>
               <li>The primary method of this study will be a focus group discussion with photo and film elicitation. 
                    <ul>
                    <li>The group will last about an hour and will be in a comfy private sitting area. </li>
                    <li> Photos or short clips of popular movies with mentally ill character will be shown and then a facilitated discussion will follow. 
                    <li> The facilitators will ask thing like “How would you describe this character? How do you think the other character’s feel about them? <br>
                         What do you things should be done to/for this person?  Do you think the director got something wrong about this character? How would <br> 
                         you feel if you were this character?  Etc.”  </li>
                    <li> Conversations will be recorded and transcribed and the facilitators will record people’s affect, engagement, mood presentation,<br>
                         and any changes that occur during the conversation. </li>
                    <li> The participants will be English-speaking adults with a mental health disability according to the Social Security Administration.</li>
                    <li> There would be 20-30 people in total with 4-5 per groups.</li> </ul>
               <li>The secondary method will The Self-Stigma in Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS) as used in Corrigan et al., 2016. </li>
               <ul>
                    <li>This survey would be given before and after the primary method to have a baseline and see if reports change based on the conversation. </li>
                    <li>The conversations and observations will be coded and analyzed to see how people experience the photos, clips, and discussion </li>
               </ul>
          </ol>
       <h2> Significance and Conclusion </h2>
       <p>This research would help fill the gap of understanding of how stigma around mental illness affects those that are living with it.<br>
            It would help amplify the stories and experiences of this community and inform academics and activists at large to what needs to<br>
            change in the mass media. It may also help researchers and treatment providers by giving them insight into how media-imposed stigma <br>
            is affecting people’s wellbeing and feelings towards their diagnosis and treatment.  Because mass media is so prevalent in society <br>
            and the day-to-day lives of most individuals, it’s important that we examine it’s effects. </p>
