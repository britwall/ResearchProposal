    <h1> Rationale </h1>
        
          <p> This study seeks to explore how people living with severe mental health diagnoses experience the portrayal of mental <br>
               illness on screen.  Many people with SPMI are isolated from the public by family, houselessness, or residential and <br>
               inpatient treatment programs. What impacts might this limited access and distorted presentations from the mass media <br>
               have on their sense of self and place in society? How might negative self-perception affect treatment outcomes and <br>
               overall wellbeing? And what do individuals see as areas of challenge or hope? The results of this study would have <br>
               implications broadly for mass media, mental healthcare, and health communication.  It could encourage media creators, <br>
               activists, treatment providers, public health officials, etc. to pay closer attention to how mental illness is showing up <br>
               in TV and movies, and hopefully to advocate for more accurate/positive representation. </p>
