       <h1> Rationale </h1>
        
          <p> This study seeks to explore how people living with severe mental health diagnoses experience the portrayal of mental 
               illness on screen.  Many people with SPMI are isolated from the public by family, houselessness, or residential and 
               inpatient treatment programs. What impacts might this limited access and distorted presentations from the mass media 
               have on their sense of self and place in society? How might negative self-perception affect treatment outcomes and 
               overall wellbeing? And what do individuals see as areas of challenge or hope? The results of this study would have 
               implications broadly for mass media, mental healthcare, and health communication.  It could encourage media creators, 
               activists, treatment providers, public health officials, etc. to pay closer attention to how mental illness is showing up 
               in TV and movies, and hopefully to advocate for more accurate/positive representation. </p>
